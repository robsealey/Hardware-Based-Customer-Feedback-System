# Hardware-Based-Customer-Feedback-System
Simple customer feedback system using a Raspberry Pi.

This repo consists the required python script to run the project discusses in this video: https://youtu.be/L90YEJ0us7Q

Customer feedback is an essential part of most business operations. Knowing if the customer was happy or unhappy about the company’s products or services is of utmost importance to the company and their growth. Our system consists of a Raspberry Pi connected to buttons which the customer can press to let the company know about their feedback. This response is then stored in a separate database and for aesthetic purposes an LED matrix is lit up with a corresponding emoji to the customer’s feedback.

I have modified the code to suit my requirements and I've also posted a video https://youtu.be/jaPIYKmUspI  to show how it works.

Thanks again to Kavithvajen for this great project.
